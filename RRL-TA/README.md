# Recurrent Reinforcement Learning with Technical Indicators
**Forked from [youki-cao]([youki-cao/Recurrent-Reinforcement-Learning-in-Bitcoin-Trading: Final Thesis at Fudan University, built a trading strategy on Bitcoin market using recurrent reinforcement learning (github.com)](https://github.com/youki-cao/Recurrent-Reinforcement-Learning-in-Bitcoin-Trading))**

This is an extension of the previous RRL model that I did based on Molina's research paper. In this version, we will be using a few TA indicators such as Moving Averages, Sharpe Ratio etc to increase our performance while minimizing the trap of simply shifting prices forward.

Another difference would be the discretion of the model to buy and sell different shares at any time instead of just all-in and all-out.
